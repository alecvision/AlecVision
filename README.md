### I'm Alec ðŸ‘‹

I fell in love with software engineering in Fall of 2020. It all started with a Raspberry Pi 4 I purchased earlier that year to run HomeAssistant. As a personal shopper in the gig-economy, I grew frustrated with working for an algorithm and set out trying to create my own shop-and-deliver system using low-code tools on a computer the size of a wallet.

*Then I learned I could write Javascript in Airtable.*

Feeling the electricity humming beneath my fingertips, I grew drunk with power. It was then I knew there was no going back. Since then, I've become more fluent in Typescript than English; more comfortable in an IDE than a hammock (and I do love a good hammock). 

My passions include learning new things, writing elegant code, helping others do the same.
