### I'm Alec ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer, the founder of AlecVision, LLC, a co-organizer for Tulsa WebDevs, and, most importantly, a proud husband and father.

My passion is in growing, learning, and helping others do the same!

I've worked with and designed systems involving many modern technologies across the application stack with a strong focus on tools that eliminate 'barriers to entry' for those who want to create great software.
